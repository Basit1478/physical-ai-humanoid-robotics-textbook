# Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics for Advanced STEM Learners

## Prompt Text
```
Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics for Advanced STEM Learners

Target audience:
Students and instructors in capstone AI/robotics programs focusing on embodied intelligence.

Theme:
Embodied AI systems that connect digital intelligence with physical humanoid robots using ROS 2, simulation environments, perception frameworks, and language-driven action.

Goal:
Create a complete educational textbook that teaches the concepts, architectures, and workflows required to build an autonomous humanoid robot from simulation to real-world behavior.

Structure Requirements:
- 4 modules total
- Each module must contain 2–3 chapters
- Chapters must include explanations, diagrams (text-described), examples, learning outcomes, and summaries

Modules:
1. The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
2. The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
3. The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
4. Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Success criteria:
- Covers all modules with clear conceptual flow
- Explains the full pipeline: sensing → simulation → action → learning
```

## Response Text
Successfully created specification for AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook. Created branch 002-ai-humanoid-textbook and specification document at specs/002-ai-humanoid-textbook/spec.md.
